# Synapse Workflow Templates

Starter workflows for new and existing projects are contained within this repository.  This repository is separate from Terraform infrastructure - those modules live in separate repos.  A list of all existing workflows is under [`Workflow Directory`](#workflow-directory).

This will navigate you to the public registry of workflows.  There is a convenient search bar to find the workflow you are looking for, and scrolling down you will be presented with a section titled `By Synapse Studios` containing the organizations starter workflows.  Find the workflow you want and select `Configure`:

This will take you to an editor page where you can modify the workflow accordingly.  Update any placeholder variables, remove comments, and then commit the change via a new branch by clicking the `Start commit` button near the top right of the page:

Any further changes necessary for the workflow can be made on the branch in a local editor.
